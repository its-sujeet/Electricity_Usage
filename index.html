        <p><ul>
          <li>During the lockdown, many households received electricity bills based on estimates due to the inability of discom personnel to visit homes for meter-reading.</li>
            <li>Some consumers, particularly in metro cities, expressed concerns about receiving excessive electricity bills post-lockd</li>
            <li>A study in the United Kingdom observed increased household electricity use, linked to more people working from home and irregular routines during the pandemic.</li>
          <li>Smart meter data analysis revealed varying trends in electricity consumption across India, with some urban households in smaller towns using less electricity compared to the previous year.</li>
          <li>Understanding the factors behind the differences in electricity consumption and addressing challenges related to load management during similar events are essential.</li>

        <p>
          <li>Sustainability is essential for all organizations today. Emissions reduction is a key component of achieving sustainable operations. How can organizations integrate emissions reduction into their strategies?</li>

          <li>Heavy industries such as mining, minerals, and metals (MMM) require a substantial amount of energy for their processes. What are the challenges faced by MMM companies in reducing energy consumption while maintaining quality, quantity, and profitability?</li>

          <li>The advancement of digital technologies has improved data processing and communication capabilities. How can these technologies help identify energy-saving opportunities in heavy industries like MMM?</li>

          <li>The text highlights William Thomson's quote, "If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it." How can data measurement and analysis contribute to energy efficiency and emissions reduction in heavy industries?</li>

          <li>The text mentions Advanced Process Control (APC) as a tool for energy savings in heavy industries. What are the key principles and benefits of APC in reducing energy consumption and emissions?</li>

          <li>The example of traditional control (PID) and APC is provided for temperature control in a furnace. What are the key differences between traditional control and APC in terms of energy efficiency and emissions reduction?</li>
